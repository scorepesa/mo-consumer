**ConfigObj** is a simple but powerful config file reader and writer: an *ini
file round tripper*. Its main feature is that it is very easy to use, with a
straightforward programmer's interface and a simple syntax for config files.
It has lots of other features though :

* Nested sections (subsections), to any level
* List values
* Multiple line values
* Full Unicode support
* String interpolation (substitution)
* Integrated with a powerful validation system

    - including automatic type checking/conversion
    - and allowing default values
    - repeated sections

* All comments in the file are preserved
* The order of keys/sections is preserved
* Powerful ``unrepr`` mode for storing/retrieving Python data-types
